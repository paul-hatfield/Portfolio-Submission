8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This app reads a list if items from an external file and keeps count of any repeated items
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    Securely reading from an external file was done well. Improvements could be done by adding code to read the list from a database.
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    The most challenging part was saving the list internally and outputting the histogram. I attempted to make my code a little original by adding a green color to the histogram.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Everything I do in this project will apply in future projects, from code styling to applying Object Oriented Programming
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I tried to leave enough white space to make the code more readable. I also attempted to leave sufficent comments to make maintaining easier
